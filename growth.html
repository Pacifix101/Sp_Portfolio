                <h2>Childhood</h2>
                <p>Technology like art is a soaring exercise of the human imagination. This form of art has held me captive ever since a young age. Ever since a kid, i loved technology and always wanted to end up in the tech industry.My passion for technology came from a young age.</p>

                <h2>ALP</h2>
                <p>During lower secondary, we would have to use scratch during alp to learn about the building blocks of coding. I would look at games that other people had already developed and tried to understand the concept or the thought proccess behind it. </p>

                <h2>HTML & CSS</h2>
                <p>During upper secondary, due to my self intrest, i would try to educate myself about the coding languages and learn how to use HTML and CSS either from online websites or from watching youtube videos. I took my time to try to understand the various functions and how it all comes together. I find coding very intresting as it forces your mind to problem solve whenever there are problems or to find a alternative roudabout. I think that having fluidity while coding is important and i love the challenge that it gives. As a Personal project, i decided to code this Portfolio with HTML,CSS and javascript to work and enhance my skills. It took me a lot of attempts and trial and error but i did not give up. I try to find solutions online whenerver im stuck and how to solve it.</p>

                <p>In 2023, I decided to enhance my learnt html and css skills by creating more websites and enhancing them through better designs and javascript functions that allows the user to interact with it.</p>

                <h2>Javascript Application with API implementation</h2>
                <p>For this project, I created a movie review application with a custom API installed that uses an external database from IMDB to get movie deatils using RESTFUL API requests.</p>

                <h2>Back End development</h2>
                <p>This was a project where it took up much more time then the rest and thought me a lot more. I learned more about RESTFUL API implementations, touched on mySQL, and understood the CRUD framework. I also learned about the MVC design and DOM interface. For this project, i coded using javascript to create a RPG like eco game that uses all the skills i have learned.</p>
